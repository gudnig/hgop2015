Vagrant is a tool to ease the process of virtualization and reduces setup time. For instance developers need certain tools to develop in a certain environment. Designers need other tools. Setting up a new developer takes time. The machine needs to be configured and the right software installed. Vagrant simplifies this as you can use one vagrant file to set up everyone, which saves configuration time and gives you uniform dev environments.

VirtualBox is software that allows you to run multiple operating systems. It does this by allowing you to run virtual machines inside your operating system which simulate a computer running another operating system.


Grunt is a tool that runs tasks. The reason for it is to automate your development process. In the course of testing, deploying or development in general you may need to run many scripts and tasks. Grunt automates this process for you. For instance a grunt deploy task might run all your tests automatically and if they are successful grunt might then uglify and minify the code you are deploying and push it to a server. This can all be accomplished with one command through one grunt task.

It has a big repository of packages, it is easy for developers to publish their own packages and easy to get packages via the NPM client.
